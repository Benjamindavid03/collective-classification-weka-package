collective-classification
=========================

**[WEKA](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/) package** for algorithms around
semi-supervised learning and collective classification.

This package is based on work from the original [collective classification project](http://www.cms.waikato.ac.nz/~fracpete/projects/collective-classification/), which was a hack for WEKA 3.5.x. The package manager approach represents a clean approach which does not rely on overwriting classes anymore.

The legacy code and datasets are available from the download section as well.
